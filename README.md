# Spacial - A Portfolio Website using Vue.js / Nuxt.js
This is a project created during a bootcamp to showcase a portfolio website using the Vue.js / Nuxt.js framework. The website includes information about the developer, their projects, and their skills.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:


    git clone https://github.com/mokachinon/spacial-nuxt .


Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:

    cd portfolio-website

Then, install the dependencies:


    npm install


Finally, run the project:


    npm run dev

This will start the development server on **`http://localhost:3000/`**

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- ***assets*** - Contains global style CSS files.
- ***components*** - Contains reusable Vue components used throughout the website.
- ***pages*** - Contains the individual pages of the website.
- ***static*** - Contains static assets used in the project, such as images and CSS files.

## Technologies Used
The project was built using the following technologies:

- ***[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)*** - A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- ***[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)*** - A framework for building server-side rendered Vue.js applications.
- ***[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)*** - A library of icons and glyphs.

## Deployment
To deploy the website to a production environment, you can use the following command:

    npm run build

This will generate a production-ready version of the website in the **`dist/`** directory. You can then deploy the website using your preferred method, such as uploading it to a web server or deploying it to a cloud service.
